# PRODUCT MANUAL

Congratulations on your acquisition of a fine **CONNORTONE** product, now with innovative **HYPERCUSSION** technology, new for 1962! Your **CONNORTONE** instrument is a precision tool which should give you many years of service, precisely emulating a rotten and loose front porch floorboard. We at **CONNORTONE** pride ourselves on our commitment to the concept that musical instrument development came to a permanent end last year, and promise to continue manufacturing products that harness the awesome power of American industry in 1934.

Your new **CONNORTONE CHDR(G) CHOWDINATOR** porch board emulator includes a number of features that will contribute to your prowess as an indicator of stage levelness. The amplifier pickup cavity is lined with copper foil to eliminate electronic interference, rather than aluminum, as we have found that aluminum foil is not sufficient shielding against amplifiers, electric instruments, messages from the Devil, or the influence of Allen Dulles.

Your **CHOWDINATOR** Porch Board Emulator is equipped with both **TONE** and **VOLUME** control knobs on the rear of the instrument. They may or may not do anything useful.

# HINTS ON PLAYING YOUR CHOWDINATOR

Like every other musical instrument, your **CHOWDINATOR** Porch Board Emulator requires a small amount of study if the best results are to be obtained. Therefore, a little application will greatly increase the pleasure to be derived from this charming instrument.

Place either foot on the 12” x 6” embossed percussion surface and commence to thumping. The **CHDR(G)** is fully ambidextrous.

The tone of the instrument improves with use.
